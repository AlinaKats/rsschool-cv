About me
------------
At school, I loved computer science and dreamed of becoming a
programmer. But there were many doctors in my family. They saw me as a doctor.
I graduated from a medical university and worked as a doctor for about 2 years. But my life changed, I married and moved to another country. 
My education now is not recognized in the county I live. And my lifestyle gives me a chance to change my knowledge. 
I want to change my profession and become a valuable specialist Junior Front-end web-developer. I have a very stubborn character and I will achieve my goal.

__DESCRIPTION:__
*Colour plays an important role in our lifes. Most of us like this colour better then another. User experience specialists believe that certain colours have certain psychological meanings for us.*

*You are given a 2D array, composed of a colour and its 'common' association in each array element. The function you will write needs to return the colour as 'key' and association as its 'value'.*
```
function colourAssociation(array){
  let newArray = [];
  
  for  (let [key,value] of array) {
    newArray.push({[key]: value + ''});
  }
  return newArray;
}
```
